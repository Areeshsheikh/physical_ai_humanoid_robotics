# AI/Spec-Driven Book on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the comprehensive guide on Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics. This book bridges digital AI with humanoid robotics, guiding learners from ROS 2 fundamentals through simulation, AI brain development, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) integration, and culminating in a capstone project.

## Target Audience

This book is designed for students, educators, and AI/robotics enthusiasts with beginner to intermediate AI knowledge.

## Book Structure

The book is organized into four main modules:

### Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)
- Introduction to ROS 2 architecture, nodes, topics, services, and actions
- Python Agents and ROS 2 Integration
- URDF for Humanoids

### Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)
- Gazebo Simulation Basics
- Sensor Simulation
- Unity Integration

### Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)
- Isaac Sim Overview
- VSLAM & Navigation
- Sim-to-Real Techniques

### Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Integration
- Voice-to-Action with Whisper
- Cognitive Planning
- Capstone: Autonomous Humanoid

## Getting Started

Begin with [Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)](./module-1/introduction.md) to establish foundational knowledge before proceeding to subsequent modules.

## Out of Scope

This book focuses specifically on humanoid robotics and excludes:
- Advanced research topics beyond the current state-of-the-art in physical AI and humanoid robotics
- Robotic platforms other than humanoid robotics (e.g., industrial robotic arms, drones, wheeled robots, etc.)
- In-depth mathematical or physics derivations that go beyond conceptual understanding required for beginner to intermediate learners
